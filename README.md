# Spam Detection in Python

## Overview
This project is a **Spam Detection System** built using **Python**. It classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Preprocessing of SMS text data
- Training a machine learning model for spam classification
- Evaluating model accuracy and performance
- User-friendly implementation with Python

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, sourced from Kaggle:
[SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dhruvv1402/Spam-Detection-Python-.git
cd Spam-Detection-Python-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script to test the spam detection system:

```sh
python spam_detection.py
```

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## Model
The project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Machine Learning model** (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression) to classify SMS messages.
